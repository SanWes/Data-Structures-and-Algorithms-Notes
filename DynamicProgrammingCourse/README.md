## Dynamic Programming

- **Resource**: [Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&t=1922s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
- **Overview**: Dynamic Programming involves breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations. It's a powerful technique used to solve optimization problems efficiently.

---

## Memoization

- **Definition**: Memoization is a technique that involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. It helps improve the performance of algorithms by avoiding redundant calculations.
- **Usage**: Memoization often involves using data structures like dictionaries to store previously computed results for future reference.

---

## Fibonacci Sequence

- **Definition**: The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. 

- **Application**: Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence is crucial in algorithmic problem-solving and recursion-based solutions.

## Dictionary Usage for Storing Computation Results

- **Purpose**: Utilizing dictionaries or hash maps is a common practice to store computed results in key-value pairs. This helps in accessing and reusing these results efficiently during algorithmic computations.
