Time Stamp: 4:20:30

Transition to strings tabulation. 

Using canConstruct function from earlier. 


Write a function canConstruct(target, wordBank)
Accepts target string and array of strings

Should return Boolean -> true if 'target' can be formed by concatenating strings from 'wordBank'

May  reuse elements of 'wordBank' as many times as needed



Pseudo Coding 
Base Case: index 0 is true 

table length = target.length
